- **Central Tendency**: Mean=67.17, Median=68.00
- **Variability**: Standard deviation=13.98
- **Missing Values**: 495 records (3.11% - manageable)
- **Outliers**: Minimal outliers detected using IQR method

### Numerical Features Analysis
- **Age**: Range -5 to 16 years (critical data quality issue with negative values)
- **Hours per week**: Range 0-20 hours, mean ≈ 10 hours
- **Attendance rate**: Range 40-100%, with 778 missing values (4.89%)
- **Sleep/Wake times**: Reasonable ranges indicating normal sleep patterns
- **Number of siblings**: Discrete values 0-5, most students have 1-2 siblings

### Categorical Features Analysis
- **Gender**: Well-balanced (Male: 7,984, Female: 7,916)
- **Direct admission**: Majority through regular admission (No: 11,195, Yes: 4,705)
- **CCA participation**: Evenly distributed (Clubs: 3,912, Sports: 3,865, None: 3,829)
- **Learning style**: Auditory learners predominant (Auditory: 9,132, Visual: 6,768)
- **Transportation**: Varied modes with reasonable distributions

- **Minor**: Case inconsistencies in categorical features (e.g., 'CLUBS' vs 'Clubs')
- **Missing Data**: Concentrated in attendance_rate (4.89%) and final_test (3.11%)
- **Duplicates**: No exact duplicates found - all 15,900 records are unique

## Recommendations for Phase 3

### Priority 1: Critical Data Quality Issues
1. **Age Data Correction**:
   - **Action**: Remove or correct 5 records with negative age values (-5)
   - **Method**: Either exclude these records or investigate if they represent data entry errors
   - **Impact**: Critical for model validity

2. **Categorical Data Standardization**:
   - **Tuition**: Standardize 'Y' to 'Yes' for consistency
   - **Case normalization**: Convert 'CLUBS' to 'Clubs' format
   - **Method**: Apply consistent string formatting across all categorical features

### Priority 2: Missing Data Strategy
3. **Missing Data Imputation**:
   - **Attendance_rate** (4.89% missing): Use median imputation or regression-based imputation
   - **Final_test** (3.11% missing): Consider excluding from training or use sophisticated imputation
   - **Method**: Implement multiple imputation techniques and compare performance

### Priority 3: Feature Engineering Opportunities
4. **Derived Features Creation**:
   - **Sleep duration**: Calculate from sleep_time and wake_time
   - **Study intensity**: Combine hours_per_week with attendance_rate
   - **Academic support index**: Combine tuition, direct_admission, and CCA participation
   - **Age groups**: Create categorical age bands for better interpretability

5. **Interaction Features**:
   - **Study habits × Learning style**: Interaction between hours_per_week and learning_style
   - **Support × Performance**: Interaction between academic support factors and attendance
   - **Demographics × Academics**: Gender and age interactions with study patterns

### Priority 4: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
6. **Feature Scaling and Encoding**:
   - **Numerical features**: Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
   - **Categorical features**: Use OneHotEncoder for nominal, LabelEncoder for ordinal
   - **Target variable**: Consider transformation if skewness increases

7. **Outlier Treatment**:
   - **Hours_per_week**: Investigate outliers (>15 hours) - may be valid extreme values
   - **Attendance_rate**: Handle outliers (<50%) carefully as they may represent at-risk students
   - **Method**: Use domain knowledge to decide between removal, capping, or transformation

8. **Data Splitting Strategy**:
   - **Train/Validation/Test**: 70/15/15 split with stratification on target variable
   - **Cross-validation**: Implement 5-fold CV for robust model evaluation
   - **Temporal considerations**: Check if student_id contains temporal information for proper splitting

### Priority 5: Advanced Preprocessing
9. **Feature Selection Preparation**:
   - **Correlation-based**: Remove features with correlation >0.95
   - **Variance-based**: Remove low-variance features
   - **Statistical tests**: Prepare for univariate feature selection

10. **Data Validation Framework**:
    - **Schema validation**: Ensure data types and ranges are correct
    - **Business rule validation**: Implement logical consistency checks
    - **Pipeline testing**: Create unit tests for all preprocessing steps
