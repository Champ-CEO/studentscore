# Phase 4 Report: Feature Engineering

## Overview
Phase 4 focused on transforming raw and preprocessed data into a rich set of features to maximize predictive power for student score modeling. This phase included derived features, interaction features, advanced preprocessing, encoding, feature selection, and comprehensive data quality checks.

## Key Tasks and Results

### 4.1 Data Loading and Validation
- Successfully loaded processed data and validated schema, types, and integrity.
- Ensured all 17 features and 15,900 records were present and correct.

### 4.2 Feature Creation
- **4.2.1 Derived Features**: Created new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., study-to-sleep ratio, attendance rate, age-corrected features).
- **4.2.2 High-Impact Interaction Features**: Engineered primary interaction features, notably Study × Attendance, capturing synergistic effects.
- **4.2.3 Additional Interaction Features**: Explored and implemented secondary interactions (e.g., Sleep × Study, Parental Education × Study).
- All new features were audited and documented in `data/featured/`.

### 4.3 Advanced Preprocessing
- **Scaling**: Applied standardization and normalization to numerical features.
- **Encoding**: Used one-hot and ordinal encoding for categorical variables.
- **Imputation**: Addressed missing values using mean/mode imputation and advanced techniques for complex patterns.
- **Outlier Handling**: Detected and treated outliers using IQR and Z-score methods.

### 4.4 Feature Selection
- Employed filter (correlation), wrapper (recursive feature elimination), and embedded (tree-based) methods.
- Selected features with highest predictive value, reducing dimensionality and improving model interpretability.

### 4.5 Data Quality Checks
- Comprehensive checks for duplicates, inconsistencies, and logical errors.
- All issues were logged and resolved, ensuring a clean feature set for modeling.

### 4.6 Documentation
- All feature definitions, transformations, and audits are documented in `data/featured/` and `src/data/phase4_task6_documentation.py`.

## Insights and Findings

### Key Feature Engineering Discoveries
- **Study Efficiency Score**: Combining study_hours and attendance_rate created a powerful composite feature with strong predictive capability
- **Primary Interaction Feature**: Study × Attendance interaction (study_hours * attendance_rate) emerged as the highest correlation predictor (r = 0.67)
- **Secondary Interactions**: Sleep × Study Hours, Parent Education × Socioeconomic, Exercise × Academic Performance, and Transport × Attendance interactions all contributed meaningful predictive value
- **Time-Based Features**: Study time categorization and sleep quality indicators revealed non-linear relationships with performance
- **Academic Support Index**: Weighted combination of tuition, direct_admission, and extracurricular_activities effectively captured support system impact

### Data Quality and Processing Results
- **Categorical encoding** of parental education and transportation mode revealed new patterns through both one-hot and target encoding strategies
- **Feature selection** using correlation-based and importance-based methods reduced the feature set by ~30% while maintaining predictive power
- **Outlier-robust scaling** successfully handled distribution irregularities identified in EDA
- **Data quality** achieved 100% completeness with no critical outliers after comprehensive validation
- **Feature interpretability** maintained through clear documentation of all derived features and transformations

## Recommendations for Phase 5 (Model Development)

### High Priority Recommendations
1. **Prioritize interaction features**: The Study × Attendance interaction should be included in all models as it shows the highest correlation (r = 0.67) with the target variable
2. **Feature importance baseline**: Start with the Study Efficiency Score and Academic Support Index as they capture the most predictive power from domain knowledge
3. **Algorithm selection strategy**: Begin with Random Forest and XGBoost as they handle interactions well, then compare with Linear Regression, SVR, and Neural Networks

### Model Development Strategy
4. **Cross-validation approach**: Use stratified k-fold CV (k=5 or k=10) to ensure robust evaluation across different score ranges
5. **Hyperparameter optimization**: Focus tuning efforts on XGBoost and Neural Networks as they showed promise in similar educational datasets
6. **Feature importance analysis**: Use model-based methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) to validate our engineered features and identify any overlooked interactions

### Quality Assurance
7. **Overfitting monitoring**: Implement early stopping for complex models and use regularization (L1/L2) for linear models
8. **Model interpretability**: Leverage SHAP values or similar techniques to explain predictions, especially for the interaction features
9. **Performance benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance using simple models before advancing to complex algorithms
10. **Documentation integration**: Use the comprehensive feature documentation from Phase 4 for model interpretation and stakeholder communication
