# Student Score Prediction Project - Task Management Document

## Purpose

This document tracks current tasks, backlog, sub-tasks, and discoveries made during development of the Student Score Prediction system. It follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where tests are written before implementation, ensuring robust and reliable code delivery.

**Key Principles:**
- All major functionality must have tests written BEFORE implementation
- Each task includes specific test requirements and success criteria
- Database usage and data flow are clearly specified at each stage
- Tasks are organized by project phases with clear dependencies
- Status tracking enables progress monitoring and bottleneck identification
